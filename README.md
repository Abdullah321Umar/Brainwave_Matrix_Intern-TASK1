## 🛒 Task 1 | Walmart Sales Analysis 📊

Welcome to the Walmart Sales Analysis Project!
This project dives deep into retail sales data from Walmart 🏬, exploring sales trends, seasonality, external factors, and store-wise performance. The goal is to gain actionable insights that can help decision-making in a commercial retail setting.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview:
Retail businesses generate huge volumes of sales data every week. Analyzing this data is crucial for:
- ✨ Understanding consumer buying patterns
- ✨ Measuring the impact of holidays, temperature, and fuel prices on sales
- ✨ Identifying top-performing stores
- ✨ Forecasting future sales for better decision-making
In this project, we use the Walmart Weekly Sales Dataset 🗂️ to uncover valuable insights and present them through visualizations, statistics, and reports.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔹 Understand the dataset and business context
- 🔹 Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
- 🔹 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔹 Build interactive and insightful visualizations
- 🔹 Generate key insights and findings
- 🔹 Export results into a PowerPoint report and cleaned dataset

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python 🐍
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn 📊
- Reporting: Python-PPTX for automated PowerPoint generation 🖼️
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📂 Dataset:
### 📌 Dataset Source: Walmart Weekly Sales Dataset
### 📌 Columns Included:
- 🏬 Store – Store ID
- 📅 Date – Week ending date
- 💰 Weekly_Sales – Revenue generated each week
- 🎉 Holiday_Flag – Indicates holiday weeks (1 = holiday, 0 = non-holiday)
- 🌡️ Temperature – Weekly average temperature
- ⛽ Fuel_Price – Fuel price in the region
- 📈 CPI – Consumer Price Index
- 👷 Unemployment – Unemployment rate

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔬
- Analyzed total and average weekly sales
- Compared holiday vs non-holiday sales
- Identified top-performing stores
- Studied the effect of temperature, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment on sales
### 4️⃣ Data Visualization 📊
- Created multiple visualizations to make insights clearer:
- 📈 Line Plots – Sales trends over time
- 📊 Bar Charts – Store-wise sales performance
- 📉 Histogram & KDE – Distribution of weekly sales
- 🔥 Heatmaps – Correlation analysis
- 🌎 Boxplots – Holiday vs Non-Holiday comparisons
### 5️⃣ Insights & Reporting 📝
- Generated key findings, such as:
### 🔝 Store 20 had the highest total and average sales
- 🎉 Holiday weeks showed a noticeable increase in sales
- 📆 December 2010 recorded the highest monthly sales
- 📉 Sales trends were influenced by economic indicators like CPI & Unemployment
### 6️⃣ Automated PowerPoint Report 🖥️
- Exported all charts and insights into a professional PowerPoint presentation
